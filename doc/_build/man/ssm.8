.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
System Storage Manager provides easy to use command line interface to manage
your storage using various technologies like lvm, btrfs, encrypted volumes and
more.
.sp
In more sophisticated enterprise storage environments, management with Device
Mapper (dm), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), or Multiple Devices (md) is
becoming increasingly more difficult.  With file systems added to the mix, the
number of tools needed to configure and manage storage has grown so large that
it is simply not user friendly.  With so many options for a system
administrator to consider, the opportunity for errors and problems is large.
.sp
The btrfs administration tools have shown us that storage management can be
simplified, and we are working to bring that ease of use to Linux filesystems
in general.

.SH SYSTEM STORAGE MANAGER COMMANDS
.SS Introduction
.sp
System Storage Manager have several commands you can specify on the command
line as a first argument to the ssm. They all have specific use and its own
arguments, but global ssm arguments are propagated to all commands.
.SS Create command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBcreate\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-s\fP SIZE] [\fB\-n\fP NAME] [\fB\-\-fstype\fP FSTYPE] [\fB\-r\fP LEVEL] [\fB\-I\fP STRIPESIZE] [\fB\-i\fP STRIPES] [\fB\-p\fP POOL] [\fBdevice\fP [\fBdevice\fP ...]] [mount]
.sp
This command creates a new volume with defined parameters. If \fBdevice\fP is
provided it will be used to create a volume, hence it will be added into the
\fBpool\fP prior the volume creation (See \fIAdd command section\fP). More devices can be used to create a volume.
.sp
If the \fBdevice\fP is already used in the different pool, then \fBssm\fP will
ask you whether you want to remove it from the original pool. If you decline,
or the removal fails, then the \fBvolume\fP creation fails if the \fISIZE\fP was
not provided. On the other hand, if the \fISIZE\fP is provided and some devices
can not be added to the \fBpool\fP the volume creation might succeed if there
is enough space in the \fBpool\fP.
.sp
\fIPOOL\fP name can be specified as well. If the pool exists new volume will be
created from that pool (optionally adding \fBdevice\fP into the pool). However
if the \fIPOOL\fP does not exist \fBssm\fP will attempt to create a new pool with
provided \fBdevice\fP and then create a new volume from this pool. If
\fB\-\-backend\fP argument is omitted, the default \fBssm\fP backend will be used.
Default backend is \fIlvm\fP.
.sp
\fBssm\fP also supports creating RAID configuration, however some back\-ends
might not support all the levels, or it might not support RAID at all. In
this case, volume creation will fail.
.sp
If \fBmount\fP point is provided \fBssm\fP will attempt to mount the volume after
it is created. However it will fail if mountable file system is not present
on the volume.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h,  \-\-help
show this help message and exit
.TP
.BI \-s \ SIZE, \ \-\-size \ SIZE
Gives the size to allocate for the new logical volume
A size suffix K|k, M|m, G|g, T|t, P|p, E|e can be used
to define \(aqpower of two\(aq units. If no unit is
provided, it defaults to kilobytes. This is optional
if if not given maximum possible size will be used.
.TP
.BI \-n \ NAME, \ \-\-name \ NAME
The name for the new logical volume. This is optional
and if omitted, name will be generated by the
corresponding backend.
.TP
.BI \-\-fstype \ FSTYPE
Gives the file system type to create on the new
logical volume. Supported file systems are (ext3,
ext4, xfs, btrfs). This is optional and if not given
file system will not be created.
.TP
.BI \-r \ LEVEL, \ \-\-raid \ LEVEL
Specify a RAID level you want to use when creating a
new volume. Note that some backends might not
implement all supported RAID levels. This is optional
and if no specified, linear volume will be created.
You can choose from the following list of supported
levels (0,1,10).
.TP
.BI \-I \ STRIPESIZE, \ \-\-stripesize \ STRIPESIZE
Gives the number of kilobytes for the granularity of
stripes. This is optional and if not given, backend
default will be used. Note that you have to specify
RAID level as well.
.TP
.BI \-i \ STRIPES, \ \-\-stripes \ STRIPES
Gives the number of stripes. This is equal to the
number of physical volumes to scatter the logical
volume. This is optional and if stripesize is set and
multiple devices are provided stripes is determined
automatically from the number of devices. Note that
you have to specify RAID level as well.
.TP
.BI \-p \ POOL, \ \-\-pool \ POOL
Pool to use to create the new volume.
.UNINDENT
.SS List command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBlist\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [{volumes,vol,dev,devices,pool,pools,fs,filesystems,snap,snapshots}]
.sp
List informations about all detected devices, pools, volumes and snapshots found
in the system. \fBlist\fP command can be used either alone to list all the
information, or you can request specific section only.
.sp
Following sections can be specified:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B {volumes | vol}
List information about all \fBvolumes\fP found in the system.
.TP
.B {devices | dev}
List information about all \fBdevices\fP found in the system. Some devices are
intentionally hidden, like for example cdrom, or DM/MD devices since those
are actually listed as volumes.
.TP
.B {pools | pool}
List information about all \fBpools\fP found in the system.
.TP
.B {filesystems | fs}
List information about all volumes containing \fBfilesystems\fP found in
the system.
.TP
.B {snapshots | snap}
List information about all \fBsnapshots\fP found in the system. Note that some
back\-ends does not support snapshotting and some can not distinguish between
snapshot and regular volume. in this case \fBssm\fP will try to recognize
volume name in order to identify \fBsnapshot\fP, but if the \fBssm\fP regular
expression does not match the snapshot pattern, this snapshot will not be
recognized.

.UNINDENT
.SS Remove command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBremove\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-a\fP] [\fBitems\fP [\fBitems\fP ...]]
.sp
This command removes \fBitem\fP from the system. Multiple items can be specified.
If the \fBitem\fP can not be removed for some reason, it will be skipped.
.sp
\fBitem\fP can represent:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B device
Remove \fBdevice\fP from the pool. Note that this can not be done in some
cases where the device is used by pool. You can use \fB\-f\fP argument to
\fIforce\fP removal. If the device does not belong to any pool, it will be
skipped.
.TP
.B pool
Remove the \fBpool\fP from the system. This will also remove all volumes
created from that pool.
.TP
.B volume
Remove the \fBvolume\fP from the system. Note that this will fail if the
\fBvolume\fP is mounted and it can not be \fIforced\fP with \fB\-f\fP.
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.SS Resize command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBresize\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-s\fP SIZE] \fBvolume\fP [\fBdevice\fP [\fBdevice\fP ...]]
.sp
Change size of the \fBvolume\fP and file system. If there is no file system only
the \fBvolume\fP itself will be resized. You can specify \fBdevice\fP to add into
the \fBvolume\fP pool prior the resize. Note that \fBdevice\fP will only be added
into the pool if the \fBvolume\fP size is going to grow.
.sp
If the \fBdevice\fP is already used in the different pool, then \fBssm\fP will
ask you whether you want to remove it from the original pool.
.sp
In some cases file system has to be mounted in order to resize. This will be
handled by \fBssm\fP automatically by mounting the \fBvolume\fP temporarily.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h,  \-\-help
show this help message and exit
.TP
.BI \-s \ SIZE, \ \-\-size \ SIZE
New size of the volume. With the + or \- sign the value
is added to or subtracted from the actual size of the
volume and without it, the value will be set as the
new volume size. A size suffix of [k|K] for kilobytes,
[m|M] for megabytes, [g|G] for gigabytes, [t|T] for
terabytes or [p|P] for petabytes is optional. If no
unit is provided the default is kilobytes.
.UNINDENT
.SS Check command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBcheck\fP [\fB\-h\fP] \fBdevice\fP [\fBdevice\fP ...]
.sp
Check the file system consistency on the \fBvolume\fP. You can specify multiple
volumes to check. If there is no file system on the \fBvolume\fP, this \fBvolume\fP
will be skipped.
.sp
In some cases file system has to be mounted in order to check the file system

.sp
Take a snapshot of existing \fBvolume\fP. This operation will fail if back\-end
which the \fBvolume\fP belongs to does not support snapshotting. Note that
you can not specify both \fINAME\fP and \fIDESC\fP since those options are mutually
exclusive.
.sp
In some cases file system has to be mounted in order to take a snapshot of
the \fBvolume\fP. This will be handled by \fBssm\fP automatically by mounting the
\fBvolume\fP temporarily.

.SH BACK-ENDS
.SS Introduction
.sp
Ssm aims to create unified user interface for various technologies like Device
Mapper (dm), Btrfs file system, Multiple Devices (md) and possibly more. In
order to do so we have a core abstraction layer in \fBssmlib/main.py\fP. This
abstraction layer should ideally know nothing about the underlying technology,
but rather comply with \fBdevice\fP, \fBpool\fP and \fBvolume\fP abstraction.
.sp
Various backends can be registered in \fBssmlib/main.py\fP in order to handle
specific storage technology implementing methods like \fIcreate\fP, \fIsnapshot\fP, or
\fIremove\fP volumes and pools. The core will then call these methods to manage
the storage without needing to know what lies underneath it. There are already
several backends registered in ssm.
.SS Btrfs backend
.sp
Btrfs is the file system with many advanced features including volume
management. This is the reason why btrfs is handled differently than other
\fIconventional\fP file systems in \fBssm\fP. It is used as a volume
management back\-end.
.sp
Pools, volumes and snapshots can be created with btrfs backend and here
is what it means from the btrfs point of view:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pool
Pool is actually a btrfs file system itself, because it can be extended
by adding more devices, or shrink by removing devices from it. Subvolumes
and snapshots can also be created. When the new btrfs pool should be created
\fBssm\fP simply creates a btrfs file system, which means that every new
btrfs pool has one volume of the same name as the pool itself which can
not be removed without removing the entire pool. Default btrfs pool name is
\fBbtrfs_pool\fP.
.sp
When creating new btrfs pool, the name of the pool is used as the file
system label. If there is already existing btrfs file system in the system
without a label, btrfs pool name will be generated for internal use
in the following format "btrfs_{device base name}".
.sp
Btrfs pool is created when \fBcreate\fP or \fBadd\fP command is used with
devices specified and non existing pool name.
.TP
.B volume
Volume in btrfs back\-end is actually just btrfs subvolume with the
exception of the first volume created on btrfs pool creation, which is
the file system itself. Subvolumes can only be created on btrfs file
system when the it is mounted, but user does not have to
worry about that, since \fBssm\fP will automatically mount the file
system temporarily in order to create a new subvolume.
.sp
Volume name is used as subvolume path in the btrfs file system and every
object in this path must exists in order to create a volume. Volume name
for internal tracking and for representing to the user is generated in
the format "{pool_name}:{volume name}", but volumes can be also referenced
with its mount point.
.sp
Btrfs volumes are only shown in the \fIlist\fP output, when the file system is
mounted, with the exception of the main btrfs volume \- the file system
itself.
.sp
New btrfs volume can be created with \fBcreate\fP command.
.TP
.B snapshot
Btrfs file system support subvolume snapshotting, so you can take a snapshot
of any btrfs volume in the system with \fBssm\fP. However btrfs does not
distinguish between subvolumes and snapshots, because snapshot actually is
just a subvolume with some block shared with different subvolume. It means,
that \fBssm\fP is not able to recognize btrfs snapshot directly, but instead
it is trying to recognize special name format of the btrfs volume. However,
if the \fINAME\fP is specified when creating snapshot which does not match the
special pattern, snapshot will not be recognized by the \fBssm\fP and it will
be listed as regular btrfs volume.
.sp
New btrfs snapshot can be created with \fBsnapshot\fP command.
.TP
.B device
Btrfs does not require any special device to be created on.
.UNINDENT
.SS Lvm backend
.sp
Pools, volumes and snapshots can be created with lvm, which pretty much match
the lvm abstraction.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pool
Lvm pool is just \fIvolume group\fP in lvm language. It means that it is
grouping devices and new logical volumes can be created out of the lvm
pool. Default lvm pool name is \fBlvm_pool\fP.
.sp
Lvm pool is created when \fBcreate\fP or \fBadd\fP command is used with
devices specified and non existing pool name.
.TP
.B volume
Lvm volume is just \fIlogical volume\fP in lvm language. Lvm volume can be
created wit \fBcreate\fP command.
.TP
.B snapshot
Lvm volumes can be snapshotted as well. When a snapshot is created from
the lvm volume, new \fIsnapshot\fP volume is created, which can be handled as
any other lvm volume. Unlike \fIbtrfs\fP lvm is able
to distinguish snapshot from regular volume, so there is no need for a
snapshot name to match special pattern.
.TP
.B device
Lvm requires \fIphysical device\fP to be created on the device, but with
\fBssm\fP this is transparent for the user.
.UNINDENT
.SS Crypt backend
.sp
Crypt backend in \fBssm\fP is currently limited to only gather the information
about encrypted volumes in the system. You can not create or manage encrypted
volumes or pools, but it will be extended in the future.
