Take a snapshot of an existing **volume**. This operation will fail if the
back-end to which the **volume** belongs to does not support snapshotting.
Note that you cannot specify both *NAME* and *DESC* since those options are
mutually exclusive.

In some cases the file system has to be mounted in order to take a snapshot of
the **volume**. This will be handled by **ssm** automatically by mounting the
**volume** temporarily.
