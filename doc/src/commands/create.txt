This command creates a new volume with defined parameters. If a **device** is
provided it will be used to create the volume, hence it will be added into the
**pool** prior to volume creation (See :ref:`Add command section
<add-command>`). More than one device can be used to create a volume.

If the **device** is already being used in a different pool, then **ssm** will
ask you whether you want to remove it from the original pool. If you decline,
or the removal fails, then the **volume** creation fails if the *SIZE* was not
provided. On the other hand, if the *SIZE* is provided and some devices can
not be added to the **pool**, the volume creation might still succeed if there
is enough space in the **pool**.

In addition to specifying size of the volume directly, percentage can be
specified as well. Specify **--size 70%** to indicate the volume size to be
70% of total pool size. Additionally, percentage of the used, or free pool
space can be specified as well using keywords FREE, or USED respectively.

The *POOL* name can be specified as well. If the pool exists, a new volume
will be created from that pool (optionally adding **device** into the pool).
However if the *POOL* does not exist, then **ssm** will attempt to create a
new pool with the provided **device**, and then create a new volume from this
pool. If the **--backend** argument is omitted, the default **ssm** backend
will be used. The default backend is *lvm*.

**ssm** also supports creating a RAID configuration, however some back-ends
might not support all RAID levels, or may not even support RAID at all. In
this case, volume creation will fail.

If a **mount** point is provided, **ssm** will attempt to mount the volume
after it is created. However it will fail if mountable file system is not
present on the volume.
