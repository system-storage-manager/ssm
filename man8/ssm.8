.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
System Storage Manager provides an easy to use command line interface to
manage your storage using various technologies like lvm, btrfs, encrypted
volumes and more.
.sp
In more sophisticated enterprise storage environments, management with Device
Mapper (dm), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), or Multiple Devices (md) is
becoming increasingly more difficult.  With file systems added to the mix, the
number of tools needed to configure and manage storage has grown so large that
it is simply not user friendly.  With so many options for a system
administrator to consider, the opportunity for errors and problems is large.
.sp
The btrfs administration tools have shown us that storage management can be
simplified, and we are working to bring that ease of use to Linux filesystems
in general.

.SH SYSTEM STORAGE MANAGER COMMANDS
.SS Introduction
.sp
System Storage Manager has several commands that you can specify on the
command line as a first argument to ssm. They all have a specific use and
their own arguments, but global ssm arguments are propagated to all commands.
.SS Create command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBcreate\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-s\fP SIZE] [\fB\-n\fP NAME] [\fB\-\-fstype\fP FSTYPE] [\fB\-r\fP LEVEL] [\fB\-I\fP STRIPESIZE] [\fB\-i\fP STRIPES] [\fB\-p\fP POOL] [\fB\-e\fP [{luks,plain}]] [\fB\-o\fP MNT_OPTIONS] [\fB\-v\fP VIRTUAL_SIZE] [\fBdevice\fP [\fBdevice\fP ...]] [mount]
.sp
This command creates a new volume with defined parameters. If a \fBdevice\fP is
provided it will be used to create the volume, hence it will be added into the
\fBpool\fP prior to volume creation (See \fIAdd command section\fP). More than one device can be used to create a volume.
.sp
If the \fBdevice\fP is already being used in a different pool, then \fBssm\fP will
ask you whether you want to remove it from the original pool. If you decline,
or the removal fails, then the \fBvolume\fP creation fails if the \fISIZE\fP was not
provided. On the other hand, if the \fISIZE\fP is provided and some devices can
not be added to the \fBpool\fP, the volume creation might still succeed if there
is enough space in the \fBpool\fP\&.
.sp
In addition to specifying size of the volume directly, percentage can be
specified as well. Specify \fB\-\-size 70%\fP to indicate the volume size to be
70% of total pool size. Additionally, percentage of the used, or free pool
space can be specified as well using keywords FREE, or USED respectively.
.sp
The \fIPOOL\fP name can be specified as well. If the pool exists, a new volume
will be created from that pool (optionally adding \fBdevice\fP into the pool).
However if the \fIPOOL\fP does not exist, then \fBssm\fP will attempt to create a
new pool with the provided \fBdevice\fP, and then create a new volume from this
pool. If the \fB\-\-backend\fP argument is omitted, the default \fBssm\fP backend
will be used. The default backend is \fIlvm\fP\&.
.sp
\fBssm\fP also supports creating a RAID configuration, however some back\-ends
might not support all RAID levels, or may not even support RAID at all. In
this case, volume creation will fail.
.sp
If a \fBmount\fP point is provided, \fBssm\fP will attempt to mount the volume
after it is created. However it will fail if mountable file system is not
present on the volume.
.sp
If the backend allows it (currently only supported with \fBlvm\fP backend),
\fBssm\fP can be used to create \fBthinly provisioned volumes\fP by specifying
\fB\-\-virtual\-size\fP option. This will automatically create a \fBthin pool\fP of
a given size provided with \fB\-\-size\fP option and \fBthin volume\fP of a given
size provided with \fB\-\-virtual\-size\fP option and name provided with \fB\-\-name\fP
option. Virtual size can be much bigger than available space in the \fBpool\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help
show this help message and exit
.TP
.BI \-s \ SIZE\fP,\fB \ \-\-size \ SIZE
Gives the size to allocate for the new logical volume.
A size suffix K|k, M|m, G|g, T|t, P|p, E|e can be used
to define \(aqpower of two\(aq units. If no unit is
provided, it defaults to kilobytes. This is optional
and if not given, maximum possible size will be used.
Additionally the new size can be specified as a
percentage of the total pool size (50%), as a
percentage of free pool space (50%FREE), or as a
percentage of used pool space (50%USED).
.TP
.BI \-n \ NAME\fP,\fB \ \-\-name \ NAME
The name for the new logical volume. This is optional
and if omitted, name will be generated by the
corresponding backend.
.TP
.BI \-\-fstype \ FSTYPE
Gives the file system type to create on the new
logical volume. Supported file systems are (ext3,
ext4, xfs, btrfs). This is optional and if not given
file system will not be created.
.TP
.BI \-r \ LEVEL\fP,\fB \ \-\-raid \ LEVEL
Specify a RAID level you want to use when creating a
new volume. Note that some backends might not
implement all supported RAID levels. This is optional
and if no specified, linear volume will be created.
You can choose from the following list of supported
levels (0,1,10).
.TP
.BI \-I \ STRIPESIZE\fP,\fB \ \-\-stripesize \ STRIPESIZE
Gives the number of kilobytes for the granularity of
stripes. This is optional and if not given, backend
default will be used. Note that you have to specify
RAID level as well.
.TP
.BI \-i \ STRIPES\fP,\fB \ \-\-stripes \ STRIPES
Gives the number of stripes. This is equal to the
number of physical volumes to scatter the logical
volume. This is optional and if stripesize is set and
multiple devices are provided stripes is determined
automatically from the number of devices. Note that
you have to specify RAID level as well.
.TP
.BI \-p \ POOL\fP,\fB \ \-\-pool \ POOL
Pool to use to create the new volume.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-e [{luks,plain}], \-\-encrypt [{luks,plain}]
Create encrpted volume. Extension to use can be
specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-o \ MNT_OPTIONS\fP,\fB \ \-\-mnt\-options \ MNT_OPTIONS
Mount options are specified with a \-o flag followed by
a comma separated string of options. This option is
equivalent to the \-o mount(8) option.
.TP
.BI \-v \ VIRTUAL_SIZE\fP,\fB \ \-\-virtual\-size \ VIRTUAL_SIZE
Gives the virtual size for the new thinly provisioned
volume. A size suffix K|k, M|m, G|g, T|t, P|p, E|e can
be used to define \(aqpower of two\(aq units. If no unit is
provided, it defaults to kilobytes.
.UNINDENT
.SS Info command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBinfo\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [item]
.sp
\fBEXPERIMENTAL\fP This feature is currently experimental. The output format can
change and fields can be added or removed.
.sp
Show detailed information about all detected devices, pools, volumes and
snapshots found on the system. The \fBinfo\fP command can be used either alone
to show all available items, or you can specify a device, pool, or any other
identifier to see information about the specific item.

.UNINDENT
.SS List command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBlist\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [{volumes,vol,dev,devices,pool,pools,fs,filesystems,snap,snapshots}]
.sp
Lists information about all detected devices, pools, volumes and snapshots found
on the system. The \fBlist\fP command can be used either alone to list all of the
information, or you can request specific sections only.
.sp
The following sections can be specified:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B {volumes | vol}
List information about all \fBvolumes\fP found in the system.
.TP
.B {devices | dev}
List information about all \fBdevices\fP found on the system. Some devices
are intentionally hidden, like for example cdrom or DM/MD devices since those
are actually listed as volumes.
.TP
.B {pools | pool}
List information about all \fBpools\fP found in the system.
.TP
.B {filesystems | fs}
List information about all volumes containing \fBfilesystems\fP found in
the system.
.TP
.B {snapshots | snap}
List information about all \fBsnapshots\fP found in the system. Note that
some back\-ends do not support snapshotting and some cannot distinguish
snapshot from regular volumes. In this case, \fBssm\fP will try to recognize the
volume name in order to identify a \fBsnapshot\fP, but if the \fBssm\fP regular
expression does not match the snapshot pattern, the problematic snapshot will
not be recognized.

.SS Remove command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBremove\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-a\fP] [\fBitems\fP [\fBitems\fP ...]]
.sp
This command removes an \fBitem\fP from the system. Multiple items can be
specified.  If the \fBitem\fP cannot be removed for some reason, it will be
skipped.
.sp
An \fBitem\fP can be any of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B device
Remove a \fBdevice\fP from the pool. Note that this cannot be done in some
cases where the device is being used by the pool. You can use the \fB\-f\fP argument to
\fIforce\fP removal. If the device does not belong to any pool, it will be
skipped.
.TP
.B pool
Remove a \fBpool\fP from the system. This will also remove all volumes
created from that pool.
.TP
.B volume
Remove a \fBvolume\fP from the system. Note that this will fail if the
\fBvolume\fP is mounted and cannot be \fIforced\fP with \fB\-f\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help

.UNINDENT
.SS Resize command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBresize\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-s\fP SIZE] \fBvolume\fP [\fBdevice\fP [\fBdevice\fP ...]]
.sp
Change size of the \fBvolume\fP and file system. If there is no file system, only
the \fBvolume\fP itself will be resized. You can specify a \fBdevice\fP to add into
the \fBvolume\fP pool prior the resize. Note that the \fBdevice\fP will only be added
into the pool if the \fBvolume\fP size is going to grow.
.sp
If the \fBdevice\fP is already used in a different pool, then \fBssm\fP will
ask you whether or not you want to remove it from the original pool.
.sp
In some cases, the file system has to be mounted in order to resize. This will
be handled by \fBssm\fP automatically by mounting the \fBvolume\fP temporarily.
.sp
In addition to specifying new size of the volume directly, percentage can be
specified as well. Specify \fB\-\-size 70%\fP to resize the volume to 70% of it\(aqs
original size. Additionally, percentage of the used, or free pool space can
be specified as well using keywords FREE, or USED respectively.
.sp
Note that resizing btrfs subvolume is not supported, only the whole file
system can be resized.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help
show this help message and exit
.TP
.BI \-s \ SIZE\fP,\fB \ \-\-size \ SIZE
New size of the volume. With the + or \- sign the value
is added to or subtracted from the actual size of the
volume and without it, the value will be set as the
new volume size. A size suffix of [k|K] for kilobytes,
[m|M] for megabytes, [g|G] for gigabytes, [t|T] for
terabytes or [p|P] for petabytes is optional. If no
unit is provided the default is kilobytes.
Additionally the new size can be specified as a
percentage of the original volume size ([+][\-]50%), as
a percentage of free pool space ([+][\-]50%FREE), or as
a percentage of used pool space ([+][\-]50%USED).
.UNINDENT
.SS Check command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBcheck\fP [\fB\-h\fP] \fBdevice\fP [\fBdevice\fP ...]
.sp
Check the file system consistency on the \fBvolume\fP\&. You can specify multiple
volumes to check. If there is no file system on the \fBvolume\fP, this \fBvolume\fP
will be skipped.
.sp
In some cases the file system has to be mounted in order to check the file
system.  This will be handled by \fBssm\fP automatically by mounting the
\fBvolume\fP temporarily.

.SS Snapshot command
.sp
\fBssm\fP \fBsnapshot\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-s\fP SIZE] [\fB\-d\fP DEST | \fB\-n\fP NAME] volume
.sp
Take a snapshot of an existing \fBvolume\fP\&. This operation will fail if the
back\-end to which the \fBvolume\fP belongs to does not support snapshotting.
Note that you cannot specify both \fINAME\fP and \fIDEST\fP since those options are
mutually exclusive.
.sp
In addition to specifying new size of the volume directly, percentage can be
specified as well. Specify \fB\-\-size 70%\fP to indicate the new snapshot size
to be 70% of the origin volume size. Additionally, percentage of the used,
or free pool space can be specified as well using keywords FREE, or USED
respectively.
.sp
In some cases the file system has to be mounted in order to take a snapshot of
the \fBvolume\fP\&. This will be handled by \fBssm\fP automatically by mounting the

be used to define \(aqpower of two\(aq units. If no unit is
provided, it defaults to kilobytes. This is optional
and if not given, the size will be determined

\fBssm\fP \fBadd\fP [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-p\fP POOL] \fBdevice\fP [\fBdevice\fP ...]
.sp
This command adds a \fBdevice\fP into the pool. By default, the \fBdevice\fP will
not be added if it\(aqs already a part of a different pool, but the user will be
asked whether or not to remove the device from its pool. When multiple devices
are provided, all of them are added into the pool. If one of the devices
cannot be added into the pool for any reason, the add command will fail. If no
pool is specified, the default pool will be chosen. In the case of a non
existing pool, it will be created using the provided devices.

.sp
This command will mount the \fBvolume\fP at the specified \fBdirectory\fP\&. The
\fBvolume\fP can be specified in the same way as with \fBmount(8)\fP, however in
addition, one can also specify a \fBvolume\fP in the format as it appears in the
\fBssm list\fP table.
.sp
For example, instead of finding out what the device and subvolume id of the
btrfs subvolume "btrfs_pool:vol001" is in order to mount it, one can simply
call \fBssm mount btrfs_pool:vol001 /mnt/test\fP\&.

.SH BACK-ENDS
.SS Introduction
.sp
Ssm aims to create a unified user interface for various technologies like Device
Mapper (dm), Btrfs file system, Multiple Devices (md) and possibly more. In
order to do so we have a core abstraction layer in \fBssmlib/main.py\fP\&. This
abstraction layer should ideally know nothing about the underlying technology,
but rather comply with \fBdevice\fP, \fBpool\fP and \fBvolume\fP abstractions.
.sp
Various backends can be registered in \fBssmlib/main.py\fP in order to handle
specific storage technology, implementing methods like \fIcreate\fP, \fIsnapshot\fP, or
\fIremove\fP volumes and pools. The core will then call these methods to manage
the storage without needing to know what lies underneath it. There are already
several backends registered in ssm.
.SS Btrfs backend
.sp
Btrfs is the file system with many advanced features including volume
management. This is the reason why btrfs is handled differently than other
\fIconventional\fP file systems in \fBssm\fP\&. It is used as a volume
management back\-end.
.sp
Pools, volumes and snapshots can be created with btrfs backend and here
is what it means from the btrfs point of view:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pool
A pool is actually a btrfs file system itself, because it can be extended
by adding more devices, or shrunk by removing devices from it. Subvolumes
and snapshots can also be created. When the new btrfs pool should be
created, \fBssm\fP simply creates a btrfs file system, which means that every
new btrfs pool has one volume of the same name as the pool itself which can
not be removed without removing the entire pool. The default btrfs pool
name is \fBbtrfs_pool\fP\&.
.sp
When creating a new btrfs pool, the name of the pool is used as the file
system label. If there is an already existing btrfs file system in the system
without a label, a btrfs pool name will be generated for internal use in the
following format "btrfs_{device base name}".
.sp
A btrfs pool is created when the \fBcreate\fP or \fBadd\fP command is used
with specified devices and non existing pool name.
.TP
.B volume
A volume in the btrfs back\-end is actually just btrfs subvolume with the
exception of the first volume created on btrfs pool creation, which is the
file system itself. Subvolumes can only be created on the btrfs file system
when it is mounted, but the user does not have to worry about that since
\fBssm\fP will automatically mount the file system temporarily in order to
create a new subvolume.
.sp
The volume name is used as subvolume path in the btrfs file system and
every object in this path must exist in order to create a volume. The volume
name for internal tracking and that is visible to the user is generated in the
format "{pool_name}:{volume name}", but volumes can be also referenced by its
mount point.
.sp
The btrfs volumes are only shown in the \fIlist\fP output, when the file system is
mounted, with the exception of the main btrfs volume \- the file system
itself.
.sp
Also note that btrfs volumes and subvolumes cannot be resized. This is
mainly limitation of the btrfs tools which currently do not work reliably.
.sp
A new btrfs volume can be created with the \fBcreate\fP command.
.TP
.B snapshot
The btrfs file system supports subvolume snapshotting, so you can take a
snapshot of any btrfs volume in the system with \fBssm\fP\&. However btrfs does
not distinguish between subvolumes and snapshots, because a snapshot is
actually just a subvolume with some blocks shared with a different subvolume.
This means, that \fBssm\fP is not able to directly recognize a btrfs snapshot.
Instead, \fBssm\fP will try to recognize a special name format of the btrfs
volume that denotes it is a snapshot. However, if the \fINAME\fP is specified when
creating snapshot which does not match the special pattern, snapshot will not
be recognized by the \fBssm\fP and it will be listed as regular btrfs volume.
.sp
A new btrfs snapshot can be created with the \fBsnapshot\fP command.
.TP
.B device
Btrfs does not require a special device to be created on.
.UNINDENT
.SS Lvm backend
.sp
Pools, volumes and snapshots can be created with lvm, which pretty much match
the lvm abstraction.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pool
An lvm pool is just a \fIvolume group\fP in lvm language. It means that it is
grouping devices and new logical volumes can be created out of the lvm pool.
The default lvm pool name is \fBlvm_pool\fP\&.
.sp
An lvm pool is created when the \fBcreate\fP or \fBadd\fP commands are used
with specified devices and a non existing pool name.
.sp
Alternatively a \fBthin pool\fP can be created as a result of using
\fB\-\-virtual\-size\fP option to create \fBthin volume\fP\&.
.TP
.B volume
An lvm volume is just a \fIlogical volume\fP in lvm language. An lvm volume
can be created with the \fBcreate\fP command.
.TP
.B snapshot
Lvm volumes can be snapshotted as well. When a snapshot is created from
the lvm volume, a new \fIsnapshot\fP volume is created, which can be handled as
any other lvm volume. Unlike \fIbtrfs\fP lvm is able
to distinguish snapshot from regular volume, so there is no need for a
snapshot name to match special pattern.
.TP
.B device
Lvm requires a \fIphysical device\fP to be created on the device, but with
\fBssm\fP this is transparent for the user.
.UNINDENT
.SS Crypt backend
.sp
The crypt backend in \fBssm\fP uses cryptsetup and dm\-crypt target to manage
encrypted volumes. The crypt backend can be used as a regular backend for
creating encrypted volumes on top of regular block devices, or even other
volumes (lvm or md volumes for example). Or it can be used to create
encrypted lvm volumes right away in a single step.
.sp
Only volumes can be created with crypt backend. This backend does not
support pooling and does not require special devices.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pool
The crypt backend does not support pooling, and it is not possible to
create crypt pool or add a device into a pool.
.TP
.B volume
A volume in the crypt backend is the volume created by dm\-crypt which
represents the data on the original encrypted device in unencrypted form.
The crypt backend does not support pooling, so only one device can be used
to create crypt volume. It also does not support raid or any device
concatenation.
.sp
Currently two modes, or extensions are supported: luks and plain. Luks
is used by default. For more information about the extensions, please see
\fBcryptsetup\fP manual page.
.TP
.B snapshot
The crypt backend does not support snapshotting, however if the encrypted
volume is created on top of an lvm volume, the lvm volume itself can
be snapshotted. The snapshot can be then opened by using \fBcryptsetup\fP\&.
It is possible that this might change in the future so that \fBssm\fP will
be able to activate the volume directly without the extra step.
.TP
.B device
The crypt backend does not require a special device to be created on.
.UNINDENT
.SS MD backend
.sp
MD backend in \fBssm\fP is currently limited to only gather the information
about MD volumes in the system. You can not create or manage MD volumes
or pools, but this functionality will be extended in the future.
.SS Multipath backend
.sp
Multipath backend in \fBssm\fP is currently limited to only gather the
information about multipath volumes in the system. You can not create or
manage multipath volumes or pools, but this functionality will be extended in
the future.
