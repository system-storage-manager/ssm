Installation
************

To install System Storage Manager into your system simply run:

   python setup.py install

as root in the System Storage Manager directory. Make sure that your
system configuration meets the *requirements* in order for ssm to work
correctly.

Note that you can run **ssm** even without installation by using the
local sources with:

   bin/ssm.local


Requirements
************

Python 2.6 or higher is required to run this tool. System Storage
Manager can only be run as root since most of the commands require
root privileges.

There are other requirements listed below, but note that you do not
necessarily need all dependencies for all backends. However if some of
the tools required by a backend are missing, that backend will not
work.


Python modules
==============

* os

* re

* sys

* stat

* argparse

* datetime

* threading

* subprocess


System tools
============

* tune2fs

* fsck.SUPPORTED_FS

* resize2fs

* xfs_db

* xfs_check

* xfs_growfs

* mkfs.SUPPORTED_FS

* which

* mount

* blkid

* wipefs


Lvm backend
===========

* lvm2 binaries

Some distributions (e.g. Debian) have thin provisioning tools for LVM
as an optional dependency, while others install it automatically. Thin
provisioning without these tools installed is not supported by SSM.


Btrfs backend
=============

* btrfs progs


Crypt backend
=============

* dmsetup

* cryptsetup
